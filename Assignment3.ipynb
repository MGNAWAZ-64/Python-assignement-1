    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Functions can be resused in the program(reusability).\n",
    "Functions reduce the duplication of code.\n",
    "This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "When the function is called, the code in a function executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "def keyword creates the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax\n",

    "Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is procedure to achieve a particular result.\n",

    "One Global Scope\n",
    "One Local Scope\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "When a function returns, the local scope is terminated, and all the variables in it are forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "It will returen None.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable. If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the global keyword to declare which variables are global.\n",

    "Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause and use except block to handle the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause.\n",
    "The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause."
